Step 1 :
If you are working in NYU campus, please open an iTerm window, run command
ssh -L 61861:localhost:61861 lg154@greene.hpc.nyu.edu
If you are working off campus, you should already have ssh tunneling setup through HPC bastion host,
that you can directly login to greene with command
ssh lg154@greene
Please open an iTerm window, run command
ssh -L 61861:localhost:61861 lg154@greene
Step 2:
Keep the iTerm windows in the previouse step open. Now open browser, find the line with
The Jupyter Notebook is running at: gr012.hpc.nyu.edu
the URL is something: http://localhost:61861/?token=XXXXXXXX (see your token below)
you should be able to connect to jupyter notebook running remotly on greene compute node with above url
